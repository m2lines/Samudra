class PerceiverDecoder(nn.Module):
    """A PerceiverIO-based decoder that maps a latent patch grid to full-resolution output.

    All ``nh * nw`` pos/scale-encoded latent tokens are passed as **data** to
    the PerceiverIO[2], and every output pixel position is a **query**.  Each
    query cross-attends to the full latent representation, giving it global
    spatial context — pixels near patch boundaries can attend to neighboring
    patches, and the model can learn smooth inter-patch transitions.

    Concretely:

    1. Add Aurora-style pos/scale encoding to the ``nh * nw`` latent tokens
       (telling the model *where on the globe* each patch is).
    2. Pass all encoded latents as **data** to the PerceiverIO:
       ``(B, nh * nw, C)``.
    3. Build 3D unit-sphere **queries** ``(x, y, z)`` for every output pixel
       from its lat/lon, embed them via a learned linear layer, and feed
       them to the PerceiverIO decoder head.
    4. Inside the PerceiverIO:
       a. Internal latents cross-attend to the ``nh * nw`` data tokens.
       b. The latents refine through several rounds of self-attention.
       c. A final cross-attention maps from queries to the refined latents,
          producing ``(B, H * W, out_channels)``.
    5. Reshape to ``(B, out_channels, H, W)``.

    **Spatial windowing**: When ``window_patches`` is set, the latent grid
    must be evenly divisible by ``window_patches``.  The grid is padded —
    circular along longitude (so windows near lon=0 see context from
    lon≈360) and constant-zero along latitude (poles are true boundaries)
    — then ``Tensor.unfold`` extracts fixed-size overlapping windows.
    Each block's PerceiverIO call receives the local data context plus
    the corresponding pixel queries.  Setting ``context_patches=None``
    gives each window full access to all latent tokens (windowed queries,
    global data).

    Because pixel queries are unit-sphere coordinates — continuous values
    determined by lat/lon, not grid indices — the same PerceiverIO
    generalizes across resolutions.

    Args:
        in_channels: Number of input channels from the processor.
        out_channels: Number of output channels per pixel.
        patch_extent: Spatial extent of each patch in degrees (lat, lon).
            Used for computing positional and scale encodings on latent tokens.
        queries_dim: Embedding dimension for pixel-position queries.
        perceiver_io: A PerceiverIO module.  ``dim`` must equal ``in_channels``,
            ``queries_dim`` must match this decoder's ``queries_dim``, and
            ``logits_dim`` must equal ``out_channels``.
        window_patches: Side length (in patches) of each spatial decode window.
            If ``None``, all patches are used globally (no windowing).
            E.g. ``window_patches=8`` means each PerceiverIO call covers an
            8x8 block of patches.
        context_patches: Number of extra patch rings around each window to
            include as data context.  Only used when ``window_patches`` is set.
            Default 1 gives each window one ring of neighboring patches beyond
            its own block.  ``None`` means full context — every window sees all
            latent tokens (windowed queries but global data attention).
